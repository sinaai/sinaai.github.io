    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a PhD student in Computer Science at <a href="http://www.pdx.edu" target="_blank">Portland State University</a>, 
        building on a diverse academic foundation that includes two master's degrees: one in Computer Engineering from 
        <a href="http://www.iust.ac.ir/en" target="_blank">Iran University of Science and Technology</a> and another in 
        Technology Management from the <a href="https://ut.ac.ir/en" target="_blank">University of Tehran</a>. 
        My undergraduate studies were in Industrial Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
        Passionate about artificial intelligence and technological innovation, I bring hands-on experience in software engineering 
        alongside a strong focus on strategic technology development. My research interests span Natural Language Processing, 
        Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, and I am currently engaged in advancing equitable and multilingual 
        AI systems.
