<p>
    I am currently a PhD candidate in <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/">Computer Science</a> at 
    <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/">Portland State University</a>, where I specialize in multilingual language models and 
    cross-lingual fairness in Natural Language Processing. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Engineering (Artificial Intelligence) 
    from the <a href="https://www.iust.ac.ir/">Iran University of Science and Technology</a>, where my research focused on machine 
    learning applications to predict COVID-19 patient outcomes, including mortality rates and hospitalization durations. 
    Additionally, I earned a Master’s in Technology Management from the <a href="https://ut.ac.ir/">University of Tehran</a>, 
    as well as a Bachelor’s in Industrial Engineering. My research experience spans a range of advanced AI topics, including 
    equitable clustering algorithms and multilingual question-answering systems. Most recently, I have been conducting research 
    in the <a href="https://nlp.cs.pdx.edu/">PortNLP Lab</a> under the guidance of Prof. Ameeta Agrawal, where I am dedicated to 
    developing AI models that uphold fairness and accessibility across languages and cultural contexts.
