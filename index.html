    <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm currently a PhD student in Computer Science at
            <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/">Portland State University</a>, working under the guidance of
            <a href="https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~ameeta/">Prof. Ameeta Agrawal</a> in the
            <a href="https://nlp.cs.pdx.edu/">PortNLP Lab</a>. My research dives into multilingual language models
            and making AI more fair and accessible across languages. Before starting my PhD, I earned my Master’s in
            Computer Engineering (Artificial Intelligence) at
            <a href="https://www.iust.ac.ir/">Iran University of Science and Technology</a>, where I applied machine learning
            to predict outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Earlier, I completed a Master’s in
            Technology Management at the <a href="https://ut.ac.ir/">University of Tehran</a>
            and a Bachelor's in Industrial Engineering.
            Beyond academia, I'm passionate about developing AI that respects cultural and linguistic diversity.
