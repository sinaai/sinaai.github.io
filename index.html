<p>
    I am currently pursuing my PhD in <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/">Computer Science</a> at 
    <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/">Portland State University</a>, specializing in multilingual language models and 
    cross-lingual fairness. Previously, I completed a Master’s in <a href="https://www.iust.ac.ir/">Computer Engineering</a> 
    (Artificial Intelligence) at <a href="https://www.iust.ac.ir/">Iran University of Science and Technology</a>, where 
    I focused on using machine learning methods to predict COVID-19 patient outcomes, including mortality rates and hospitalization lengths. 
    My academic journey also includes a Master’s in <a href="https://ut.ac.ir/">Technology Management</a> from the 
    <a href="https://ut.ac.ir/">University of Tehran</a> and a Bachelor's in Industrial Engineering from 
    <a href="https://www.iau.ac.ir/">Karaj Azad University</a>. My research experience spans diverse NLP topics, from equitable 
    clustering algorithms to multilingual question-answering systems, with my recent work at <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/portnlp-lab/">PortNLP Lab</a> under Prof. Ameeta Agrawal. 
    I am driven by a passion for developing AI models that perform fairly across languages and cultural contexts.
